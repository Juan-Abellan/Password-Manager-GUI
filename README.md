<h1>Password-Manager-GUI</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

In this project we are going to be creating a Password Manager GUI.
We are going to use it to store and generate passwords. If we want to create an account for a website we only have to input an email and define our own password, another option is to create a password using the password manager. 
Once we click add we will get an pop up asking for confirmation and after it the data will be added to a text file located in the computer.
